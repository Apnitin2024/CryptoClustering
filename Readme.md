Introduction- 
This challenge explores how cryptocurrency values change over time, using machine learning to analyze and cluster the data. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization.

Data-
The dataset is a CSV file (crypto_market_data.csv) that captures cryptocurrency values over time. It contains 41 rows and 8 columns, where each row represents a unique cryptocurrency, and each column represents values across different time intervals.

Methodology-
Pandas is used for reading and initial processing of the data. Data preprocessing is handled with StandardScaler from sklearn, and data visualization is conducted using hvplot. To group the cryptocurrencies, KMeans is applied for clustering, and PCA is used to reduce dimensionality to three features, simplifying the dataset for clearer visualization.

Results-
The KMeans model successfully grouped the data, and PCA was applied to reduce features, but the clusters were not sharply distinct. Despite PCAâ€™s reduction, fully separating the clusters visually was still challenging.

Conclusion-
Further analysis is needed to clarify the unique characteristics of each cluster, as cluster boundaries remain somewhat ambiguous. PCA did improve the distinction of at least one cluster, but additional investigation could provide more insight.
